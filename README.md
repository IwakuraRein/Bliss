## Rendering

I first use two blit passes to render the clouds and the terrain. They are generated by ray marching in the fragment shaders. 

A grass blade is defined by 3 positions:

Then I use the compute shader to determine the grass blades' world position v0, and simulate the forces to update v1, and v2.
